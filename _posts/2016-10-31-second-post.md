This Classic Jekyll Theme is a responsive design featuring three different view modes:

- Narrow: Everything is displayed in a single column. Intended for smartphones.
- Medium: There is a primary column and a (smaller) secondary column. Intended for tablets and small laptops.
- Wide: There are smaller secondary and tertiary columns with a wider primary column in between. Intended for laptops and desktops.

The secondary and tertiary columns can be disabled.

This theme was build starting from the default Jekyll theme "minima" and incorporates as much from that style as possible. Things like google analytics and discuss have been kept. For European sites, a cookies policy warning has been added.

In addition there is a navigation menu bar available that shows a home item, a category item, a contact item and any pages that have the appropriate YAML front matter. In the narrow and medium layouts the menu is hidden until the user taps the menu icon.

The category menu allows a drop-down of category-pages for designer selected categories. The page menus contain a drop-down of sub-pages that relate to the menu item via their YAML front matter.

Though fully functional, it is expected that the web designer will want to make changes to the design. This theme was specifically written with that goal in mind. You should find it relatively easy to identify those places where changes should or can be made. Most of the SASS and HMTL is documented for that purpose.

Please help me improve this theme further. Send suggestions, improvements and bug reports to rien@balancingrock.nl.
