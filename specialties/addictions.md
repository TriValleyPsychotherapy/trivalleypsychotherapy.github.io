Addiction to drugs and alcohol can be a chronic, often relapsing brain disease that causes compulsive drug seeking and use despite harmful consequences to the person who is addicted and those around them. Drug addiction is a brain disease because the abuse of drugs leads to changes in the structure and function of the brain. Although it is true that for most people the initial decision to take drugs is voluntary, over time the changes in the brain caused by repeated drug abuse can affect a person's self control and ability to make sound decisions, and at the same time send intense impulses to take drugs.

There is a cycle to addiction that is important to understand. Addiction is not an easy road and inpatient or outpatient treatment is usually required to control the addiction.

The main obstacle to recovering from an addiction is denial. There are five steps to addiction recovery, and the first is having an inkling that one has a problem. It may be a vague or fuzzy awareness, such as a sense that something may be wrong. The next step is awareness, or defining the problem. At this point, the problem comes into focus, and you have a choice to make: either keep on doing what you're doing (and suffer the consequences), or find a way to stop. 

If one is going to be successful in the decision to stop the addictive behavior, there are certain choices that one must face in devising a workable plan to achieve success in recovery. These choices are related to changing one's lifestyle, and involve all levels: the mental, emotional, physical, social , and spiritual aspects of one's life.

Changing the way one thinks, feels and behaves is not an easy task. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can be very helpful in efforts to clean up one's internal environment, as well as in healing feelings. When you are making the necessary changes from the inside out, you are in the fourth step, which is the action phase. Maintaining these changes, and living that new lifestyle is the fifth step, also known as recovery.
