While research suggests that sexual dysfunction is common (43% of women and 31% of men report some degree of difficulty), it is a topic that many people are hesitant to discuss. Sexual problems can be a result of a physical or psychological problem.

<ul>
<li><b>Physical causes:</b> Many physical and/or medical conditions can cause problems with sexual function. These conditions may include diabetes, heart and vascular (blood vessel) disease, neurological disorders, hormonal imbalances, menopause, chronic diseases such as kidney or liver failure, and alcoholism and drug abuse. In addition, the side effects of certain medications, including some antidepressant drugs, can affect sexual desire and function.</li>
<li><b>Psychological causes:</b> These may include work-related stress and anxiety, concern about sexual functioning, marital or relationship problems, depression, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual trauma.</li>
</ul>

Both men and women are affected by sexual problems. Sexual problems occur in adults of all ages.
