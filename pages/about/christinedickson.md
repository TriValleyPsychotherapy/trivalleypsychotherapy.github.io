__My Approach to Helping__

Unlike traditional therapy that focuses on the past, I help my clients focus on the present and take action to change unproductive thought patterns, manage your emotions, and modify old behavior patterns. With 15 years experience as a mindfulness based cognitive-behavioral therapist, I will help you take control of your mind rather than allowing your mind take control of you by dwelling on unproductive, negative thoughts and emotions. 

__More Info About My Practice__

In my 15 years as a psychologist, I have found mindfulness based cognitive-behavioral therapy to be the most effective form of therapy for my clients. Learning to find the "off button" in your mind, no longer reacting to every thought and feeling that goes through your mind, and learning to laugh at the voice in your head is priceless.

__Theoretical Influences that Guide My Work__

My work is influenced by Thich Nhat Hanh, one of the most respected Zen masters in the world, Eckart Tolle, author of The Power of Now and A New Earth, Victor Fankl, a concentration camp survivor and author of Man's Search for Meaning, and Joyce Meyer, adult survivor of severe child sexual abuse and author of Battlefield of the Mind. I am also influenced by the work of Timothy Ferris, entrepreneur and best selling author of The 4 Hour Work Week.

__How My Own Struggles Made Me a Better Therapist__

As a clinical psychologist who worked in two State Prisons, I was exposed to a world that most of us can never imagine. Violence and criminality, oppression, cruelty and abuse was a world I spent between 40 - 60 hours a week in for 5 years. The exposure to prison changed me but ONLY for the positive. It is during this time, I began aggressively practicing mindfulness and Zen meditation on a daily basis in order to combat the negativity of prison. I found a deep sense of inner peace within a chaotic and uncertain situation. I now teach clients at my office in Pleasanton to find that peace, stability, and calm regardless of their circumstances.

__Specific Issues I'm Skilled at Helping With__

I work with clients on a board range of issues such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anger management, stress management, marital and relationship issues, abuse, trauma, addiction, and sexual disorders. My experience as a clinical psychologist in many different settings such as Fortune 500 companies, hospitals, military, police departments, and even prisons has helped me gain the experience to develop expertise in many areas.
