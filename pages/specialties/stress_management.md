<p>Stress is what you feel when you have to handle more than you are used to. When you are stressed, your body responds as though you are in danger. It makes hormones that speed up your heart, make you breathe faster, and give you a burst of energy. Unmanaged stress can have long term negative consequences on your mental and physical health.  </p>
