<p>Sexuality is an important part of who we are as humans. Beyond the ability to reproduce, sexuality also defines how we see ourselves and how we physically relate to others. Sexual orientation is a term used to refer to a person's emotional, romantic, and sexual attraction to individuals of a particular gender.</p>

<p>Sexual orientation generally is divided into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Heterosexual:</b> attracted to individuals of the opposite sex</li>
<li><b>Bisexual:</b> attracted to members of either sex</li>
<li><b>Homosexual</b>: attracted to individuals of one's own sex</li>
</ul>

<p>Sexual orientation involves a person's feelings and sense of identity; it may or may not be evident in the person's appearance or behavior. People may have attractions to people of the same or opposite sex but may elect not to act on these feelings. For example, a bisexual may choose to have a monogamous relationship with one gender and, therefore, elect not to act on the attraction to the other gender.</p>

<p>One's sexual orientation also has implications at work, school and in the community. While heterosexual people are not subject to discrimination or prejudice because of their sexual orientation, bisexual and homosexual people are usually discriminated against in the workplace, ridiculed and attacked in school and by their families, and can be subject to hate crimes.</p> 

<p>Religious persecution is also of great concern limiting the spiritual choices of many homosexual and bisexual people. There is no law in the United States that prohibits discrimination based on one's sexual orientation, and marriage between same sex couples is illegal in most States.</p>
