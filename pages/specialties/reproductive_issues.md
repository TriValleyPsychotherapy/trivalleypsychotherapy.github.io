<h4>Miscarriage</h4>

<p>Today, more and more women are trying to have children later in life. Some women wait until their mid-30's to have a baby. However, what most women do not know is that 1 in 4 over the age of 35 who get pregnant and go to their first prenatal visit find out that their baby does not have a heart beat and has stopped growing. </p>

<p>It is quite a shock because most women have only heard of spontaneous miscarriages in which women experience cramping and bleeding, and the embryo is naturally lost early in the pregnancy. But what about a "missed miscarriage" at 8 - 10 weeks when the body thinks it is still pregnant and the woman feels healthy but the embryo has died and the body does not naturally miscarry the pregnancy? This can be an incredibility difficult experience for a woman.</p> 

<p>Although women can physically recover from any type of miscarriage quickly, psychological recovery can take a lot longer. </p>

<h4>Infertility</h4>

<p>In addition, women in their 30's and 40's can have difficulty conceiving. 1 in 3 women between the ages of 35â€“39, have fertility problems and infertility increases dramatically after 40. Many women who experience infertility will undergo in-vitro fertilization spending thousands and thousands of dollars trying to conceive a child only to experience a great deal of stress and one disappointment after the other.</p>
